This application is a single page Countdown Timer. By entering a time into the text field and
pressing start or the done (✔) button a timer will start counting down.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context

<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
I enjoyed week #1 of #AndroidDevChallenge and enjoyed week #2 even more. A part I am proud of is the
custom time input masking function
implemented [here](/app/src/main/java/com/example/androiddevchallenge/MainActivity.kt#L122).
